	<p>This is a special-made assignment that my partner, Jumhelle Viduya, and I made for an assignment we had in English about the Scottsboro boys.</p>
    <P>With the code we have created, you will be able to easily see all of our information that we included. This includes the diary entries we wrote about some of
	Scottsboro people, more information discussing where you can learn more about them, and our info.</p>
	<p>Even though we have the same style of coding, some of the information will be different. This is to fit what we did for the assignment / to get you to know us more.
	<p>We have also created a flow chart to help us design and organize how our coding was laid out.</p>
	<p>You can see it here:</p>
