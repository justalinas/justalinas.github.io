	<p>This game is called Pidgey Attack that made with my partner Nicholas Paz. The goal of the game is to dodge the Pidgeys that are flying around on the screen as
     long as possible while the timer is running. You control your character, the fly, with the arrow keys.</p>
	 <p>We used two variables, which are One-Way Flag and Accumulator. Our One-Way Flag is setting the option of death to false because a One-way flag variable stores whether a condition has been true yet.</P>
	 <p>Our accumulator is the timer because it maintains a running total by showing the amount of time you can last before you die.</p>
