	<p>This is one of the Repl.it projects I made with my partner, Tristan Beuman.</p>
	<p>The concept of the game is to outwit the "AI" (Studying in our case) is defeated.</p>
	<p>The player must choose between a set of moves given in order to pass his studies</p>
	<p>Both the hp levels go up to 100. For the player, indicating their stress level and studying/homework completed, for the AI.</p>
	<p>If either you or the AI gets to 100, the other one wins.</p>
	<p>We both want to credit a user by the name of acardnell24, who made the original formatting. But, we made edits / more definitions to make a lot more readable and so Tristan and I could understand it.</p>
